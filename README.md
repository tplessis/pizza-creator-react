# PizzaCreator

React version of my [PizzaCreator](https://github.com/tplessis/pizza-creator), originally developped using Angular.  

**Note:** Assets and original idea of the pizza builder from Todd Motto. [Here](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-pizza-creator) is the original version.

## Introduction

[PizzaCreator](https://pizza-creator-alpha.vercel.app/) This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular. This is not supposed to be a template or a boilerplate. It'just an opinionated app that shows how to do some things in a certain way.

**Some concepts / tools that has beeen used here :**
- [x] Tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Commitizen...)
- [x] Environment variables using a .env (dotenv)
- [x] Fully typed app using Typescript
- [x] Routing, Lazy Loading
- [x] Smart / Dumb components architecture
- [x] Reactive hooks form
- [x] A simple store using Redux Toolkit
- [x] A fresh UI using TailwindCSS with a real mobile version
- [x] CSS animations
